# Shopify GPT-3 React Application

This React App will send plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and display results in a list for the user.

## Description & Features

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

Provided options of "Red Pill" -> "text-davinci-002" or "Blue Pill" -> "text-curie-001" to try out different AI Engines.

User respones will be saved on reload or leaving the page.

Provided presets for the user to quickly try out some recommended GPT-3 prompts.

Thank you for the fun weekend GPT-3 project Shopify Team! I look forward to implementing GPT-3 in future projects to unveil more cross-functional capabilities.
